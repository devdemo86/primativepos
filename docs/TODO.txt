Add admin page with:
  sales tax due and total sales, etc.
  top selling items
  top selling customers

prevent deactivating people with a positive balance


Add gmail connectivity and connect to nightly backup, remember to add phpmailer classes

Add a add/remove cash/checks in drawer feature that writes events to the log table to 
    adjust the total upon printing the closing report
   

Figure out if refunds and everything else is working in the aging report:
daily transaction list:
SELECT CONCAT(customers.first_name, ' ', customers.last_name) AS customer, customers.tax_exempt, customers.credit, customers.id AS customer_id, customers.company, customers.use_company, ticket.id as ticket_id, ticket.date, ticket.total, ticket.payment_type, ticket.refund FROM ticket LEFT JOIN customers ON customers.id=ticket.customer_id LEFT JOIN customer_jobs ON customer_jobs.id=ticket.job_id WHERE ticket.payment_type != 'VOID' AND ticket.payment_type IS NOT NULL AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP(ticket.date) > 1379116800;


weekly chronological order of tickets to print out
prevent click on noname

updating listings on void or other type of updates?


allow printing smaller tickets along with statement printout, probably need to pass args to print_invoice.bat for
font size or use a separate batch file


indicate refund on ticket

paint mix info

Look up an item to show who has purchased it

aging report

returns on receipt?

close a job?

need labor/freight on dymo receipt and to be indicated on ticket lookup...check on discount too

show credit (-negative) balances on initial billing page

what happens when deactivating the noname acct?

don't lookup non-finalized tickets


mark as a charge

be able to change ticket id

1-1/2" or 1 1/2" pattern matching

sort catalog/billing

be able to put name on ticket before scanning items

improve misc item flexibility:

right click in cart:  'add misc'
 -- create entry in temp table

create installer


FIX editing price in catalog needs number formatting

The payment received dialog only asks for the payment and will not compute the 
change if payed in cash.

FIX name wraps over receipt length on payment of cash

FIX voiding from billing dialog to update the type to void

payment dialog should pull up the customer's amount owed, then if paying more than that amount, give the difference

allow easy import of customers and catalog from csv

Translate to other languages

Catalog needs "add to cart" feature

Catalog needs sorting

Admin options page and setup script

SQLite database
